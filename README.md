# BattleTank
An open-world head-to-head with simple AI, terrain, and advanced control system in unreal 4 ( following a tutorial from Udemy's Unreal engine c++ course)  

This is the [Unreal Engine Developer]( http://gdev.tv/urcgithub) course â€“ it started as a runaway success on Kickstarter and has gone on to become one of the bestselling Unreal courses on the internet! Continually updated in response to student suggestions, you will benefit from the fact we have already taught over 360,336 students game development, many shipping commercial games as a result.

You're welcome to download, fork or do whatever else legal with all the files! The real value is in our huge, high-quality online tutorials that accompany this repo. You can check out the course here: [Unreal Engine Developer]( http://gdev.tv/urcgithub)
